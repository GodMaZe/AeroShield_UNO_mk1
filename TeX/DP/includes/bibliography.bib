abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the problem of observability of nonlinear systems. Two sufficient conditions of global observability of nonlinear systems are presented: (1) the ratio condition which is the generalization of Fujisawa and Kuh's (1971) ratio condition of circuit theory, (2) the strongly positive semidefinite condition. The relationships between these two conditions as well as the condition of positive definiteness of Fitts (1970) are given.}
