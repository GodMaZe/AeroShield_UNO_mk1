In this section we will attempt to explain and describe the implementation of the designed controller on a \acrshort{mcu}. We will cover the hardware and software aspects of the implementation, including the selection of the \acrshort{mcu}, interfacing with sensors and actuators, and the programming of the control algorithm. We will also discuss any challenges faced during the implementation process and how they were addressed.
