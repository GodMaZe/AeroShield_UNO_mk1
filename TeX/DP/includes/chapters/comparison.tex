Within this chapter we will compare the performance of the different approaches to the implementation of the designed controllers.
We will be comparing the controller performance from simulation, Matlab implementation and \acrshort{mcu} implementation.
We will analyze the results obtained from each approach and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
