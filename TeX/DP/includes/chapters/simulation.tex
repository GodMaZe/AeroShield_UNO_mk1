Here we will simulate the system using MATLAB/Simulink to validate our theoretical findings. The simulation will model the dynamics of the system under various conditions and inputs.

\subsection{Angular Constraints}
Show that the pendulum has physical angular constraints and discuss how these constraints will be handled in the simulation environment.
